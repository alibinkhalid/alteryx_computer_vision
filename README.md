# Simplifying Image Recognition and Classification Models

## Overview
Even casual viewers can easily recognize characters from "The Simpsons" due to the show's extensive run. This familiarity is akin to the process of training image recognition models with a robust dataset.

## Data Preparation
We use a Kaggle dataset with over 16,000 images from "The Simpsons." For this example, we select 5,637 images of Homer, Marge, Bart, and Lisa, dividing them into training, validation, and holdout sets at 70%, 20%, and 10%, respectively.

Consistency in image size is crucial for model training. We standardize images to 128x128 pixels using the Image Processing Tool.

## Setting Up Image Recognition
In the Image Recognition Tool, specify the source of training and validation images and the label field. Configure epochs and batch sizes to optimize training.

## Choosing a Model
Select from pre-trained models like InceptionV3, VGG16, InceptionResNetV2, or Resnet50V2, each with distinct trade-offs in accuracy and performance.

## Model Training and Prediction
Execute the workflow and observe the training progress. Typically, accuracy improves and loss decreases over time. Save the trained model in a .yxdb file for future use.

## Performance Comparison
In tests, Resnet50V2 demonstrated the best balance of accuracy and speed. Hereâ€™s a summary of the performance metrics:

| Model              | Training Time | Prediction Time | Accuracy        |
|--------------------|---------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| InceptionV3        | 46 min        | 1 min 44 sec    | 80.46%          |
| InceptionResNetV2  | 1 hr 12 min   | 1 min 28 sec    | 83.84%          |
| VGG16              | 1 hr 54 min   | 3 min 6 sec     | 88.28%          |
| Resnet50V2         | 57 min        | 1 min 28 sec    | 89.88%          |

## Practical Applications
Image classification has vast applications. However, always consider ethical implications, especially when dealing with personal images.
