# Simplifying Image Recognition and Classification Models

## Overview
Even casual viewers can easily recognize characters from "The Simpsons" due to the show's extensive run. This familiarity is akin to the process of training image recognition models with a robust dataset.


## Data Preparation
I used a [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathurinache/simpsons-images) with over 16,000 images from "The Simpsons." For this example, I selected 5,633 images of Homer, Marge, Bart, and Lisa, dividing them into training, validation, and holdout sets at 70%, 20%, and 10%, respectively.

Consistency in image size is crucial for model training. I standardized images to 128x128 pixels using the Image Processing Tool.

## Setting Up Image Recognition
In the Image Recognition Tool, specify the source of training and validation images and the label field. Configure epochs and batch sizes to optimize training.

## Choosing a Model
Select from pre-trained models like InceptionV3, VGG16, InceptionResNetV2, or Resnet50V2, each with distinct trade-offs in accuracy and performance.


## Model Training and Prediction
Execute the workflow and observe the training progress. Typically, accuracy improves and loss decreases over time. Save the trained model in a .yxdb file for future use.

## Performance Comparison
In tests, Resnet50V2 demonstrated the best balance of accuracy and speed. Hereâ€™s a summary of the performance metrics:

| Model              | Training Time | Prediction Time | Accuracy        |
|--------------------|---------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| InceptionV3        | 46 min        | 1 min 44 sec    | 80.46%          |
| InceptionResNetV2  | 1 hr 12 min   | 1 min 28 sec    | 83.84%          |
| VGG16              | 1 hr 54 min   | 3 min 6 sec     | 88.28%          |
| Resnet50V2         | 57 min        | 1 min 28 sec    | 89.88%          |

## Practical Applications
Image classification has vast applications. However, always consider ethical implications, especially when dealing with personal images.
